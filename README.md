# Large Scale Video Retrieval using Deep Learning based Video Hashing
ConvNext CNN and transformer architecture based video retrieval system to perform large scale video retrieval for a query video from a large video database

## Overview
Due to the increasing popularity of social media
platforms and enhanced ease of access to the Internet, there
has been explosive growth in the quantity of video data being
generated throughout the world in the present era. Thus, there
is an urgent requirement for advanced techniques to perform
content-based video retrieval in a fast, accurate and efficient
manner from huge databases of video data. The existing video
retrieval systems mainly function based on a two-step process of
feature extraction and then video similarity comparison based
on extracted features. But the existing systems do not leverage
both the spatial and temporal features of video data at the
same time in the feature extraction step, and the feature vector
representations of videos are often too large, thus, making the
video similarity comparison too inefficient when dealing with
huge video databases. To tackle these challenges, this paper
proposes a novel deep learning-based system to perform large-
scale video retrieval. The proposed system uses sophisticated
convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures to extract
spatial features, transformer architectures to extract temporal
features and hashing techniques to create compact binary repre-
sentations for videos, thus allowing efficient and fast comparison.
The system is trained using a triplet-loss-based objective on the
JHMDB public video dataset, and evaluation on the same dataset
reveals that the proposed system outperforms existing video
retrieval systems in all metrics, thus, creating a new milestone
in the field of large-scale content-based video retrieval.
